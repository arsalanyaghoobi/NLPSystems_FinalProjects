Running the system model, the model will take your utterance and label it emotionally and pass it to a generative model and 
generate a response that is emotionally congruent to the input data. 
The model emotional classifier for the first utterance will be the non-contextual sentiment classifier while for the later utterances will be 
the contextual sentiment classifier.
